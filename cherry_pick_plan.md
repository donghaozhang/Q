## Execution Strategy

1. **Prepare**: Ensure we're on `feature/clean-start` branch
2. **Execute batches sequentially**: Run each batch, resolve any conflicts
3. **Test after each batch**: Verify the application still works
4. **Push after every 2-3 batches**: Keep remote updated
5. **Final verification**: Ensure all 70 commits are properly applied

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

- For `.cursor/rules` conflicts: Accept incoming changes (they're documentation updates)
- For code conflicts: Manually resolve, prioritizing functionality
- For config conflicts: Take the newer version unless it breaks something

## Rollback Plan

If any batch fails catastrophically:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~[number_of_commits_in_failed_batch]
```
