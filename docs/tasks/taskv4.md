# Task v4: Start Q Project Services Locally on Windows

## 🎯 Objective
Successfully start all Q (Suna) project services locally on Windows development environment

## 📋 Current Status Overview

### Infrastructure Services
- ✅ **Redis**: Running successfully (port 6379)
- ❌ **RabbitMQ**: Port 5672 conflict (used by Docker backend process PID 4440)
- 🔄 **Docker**: Docker Desktop running but containers have networking issues

### Backend Services
- ❌ **FastAPI Backend**: Failed to start due to Python dependency issues
- ❌ **Background Workers**: Not started (depends on backend)
- ❌ **MCP Server**: Not started

### Frontend Services
- ❌ **Next.js Frontend**: Not started (depends on backend)

## 🚧 Current Issues

### 1. Python Environment Issues
**Problem**: Pillow 10.0.0 build failure on Windows with Python 3.13.2
```
× Failed to build `pillow==10.0.0`
KeyError: '__version__'
```
**Root Cause**: 
- Python 3.13.2 compatibility issues with Pillow 10.0.0
- Windows build environment missing C++ compiler requirements
- uv package manager having issues with binary wheels

**Solutions to Try**:
- [ ] Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 instead of 3.13.2
- [ ] Install Visual Studio Build Tools for Windows
- [ ] Use Docker-based backend instead of local Python
- [ ] Update Pillow to newer version (10.4.0+)
- [ ] Use conda instead of pip/uv for package management

### 2. RabbitMQ Port Conflict
**Problem**: Port 5672 already in use by Docker backend process
```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:5672 failed: port is already allocated
```
**Root Cause**: Docker Desktop is running RabbitMQ or another service on port 5672
**Solutions to Try**:
- [ ] Stop conflicting Docker containers
- [ ] Use different port for RabbitMQ
- [ ] Kill Docker backend process (PID 4440)
- [ ] Use external RabbitMQ service

### 3. Package Version Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple package version incompatibilities
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mcp_use==1.1.0
```
**Root Cause**: 
- Some packages require Python <3.12
- Pinned versions don't exist for newer Python versions
- Package yanked versions causing conflicts

## 🔄 Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Python Environment (High Priority)
- [ ] **Action 1.1**: Check Python version and switch to 3.11 if needed
- [ ] **Action 1.2**: Install Visual Studio Build Tools for Windows
- [ ] **Action 1.3**: Try using conda environment instead of pip/uv
- [ ] **Action 1.4**: Update requirements.txt with compatible versions

### Phase 2: Resolve Port Conflicts (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Action 2.1**: Identify and stop conflicting Docker containers
- [ ] **Action 2.2**: Modify docker-compose.yaml to use different ports
- [ ] **Action 2.3**: Clean up Docker networking

### Phase 3: Start Services (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Action 3.1**: Start backend service (Docker or local)
- [ ] **Action 3.2**: Start frontend development server
- [ ] **Action 3.3**: Verify all services are accessible
- [ ] **Action 3.4**: Test end-to-end functionality

## 🔍 Investigation Commands

### Python Environment Check
```bash
python --version                    # Check Python version
python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"  # Detailed version info
conda --version                     # Check if conda is available
```

### Package Installation Tests
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip           # Update pip
pip install Pillow                  # Test Pillow installation
pip install -r requirements.txt     # Test full requirements
```

### Docker Environment Check
```bash
docker version                      # Check Docker version
docker ps -a                        # Check all containers
docker network ls                   # Check Docker networks
netstat -ano | findstr ":5672"     # Check port usage
```

### Service Health Checks
```bash
# Redis
redis-cli ping

# RabbitMQ (if running)
curl -u guest:guest http://localhost:15672/api/overview

# Backend API (if running)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```
